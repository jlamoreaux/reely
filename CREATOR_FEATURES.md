### 4. Content Guidelines
- **Sponsorship Guidelines**: `/app/creator/guidelines/page.tsx`
  - Comprehensive sponsorship rules
  - Core principles for authentic content
  - Prohibited content categories
  - Best practices guide
  - Guidelines acceptance tracking
- **Functions**: `/convex/sponsorships.ts`

### 5. Scheduled Posts
- **Scheduling System**: `/convex/scheduledPosts.ts`
  - Schedule posts for future publishing
  - Edit and cancel scheduled posts
  - Automatic publishing via cron jobs
  - Scheduling analytics
- **UI**: `/app/creator/schedule/page.tsx`
  - Calendar view of scheduled content
  - Schedule modal with date/time selection
  - Suggested optimal posting times
  - Scheduling statistics

### 6. Database Schema Enhancements
All creator-related tables added to `/convex/schema.ts`:
- `profiles` - Enhanced with creator flags and settings
- `videos` - Added creator metadata (tips, duets, scheduling)
- `creatorEarnings` - Monthly earnings tracking
- `premiumBadges` - Achievement and verification badges
- `liveStreams` - Live streaming sessions (schema ready)
- `duetRequests` - Collaboration requests (schema ready)
- `scheduledPosts` - Scheduled content queue
- `sponsorshipAgreements` - Guidelines acceptance

## Features Ready for Implementation

The following features have database schema and infrastructure ready but need UI implementation:

### 1. Live Streaming
- Schema: `liveStreams` table configured
- Needs: Streaming service integration, live video UI

### 2. Duets/Collaborations  
- Schema: `duetRequests` table configured
- Needs: Collaboration request flow, split-screen recording

### 3. Extended Video Length
- Schema: Video duration field supports any length
- Needs: Verification check, upload limit adjustment

### 4. Premium Badges
- Schema: `premiumBadges` table configured
- Needs: Badge assignment logic, display components

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Event Tracking**: All user interactions tracked in `analytics` table
2. **Aggregation**: Daily stats computed and stored in `creatorStats`
3. **Real-time Queries**: Dashboard pulls from both tables for current + historical data
4. **Caching**: Performance data cached in `postPerformance` for quick access

### Security
- All functions verify user ownership of profile
- Authentication required for all creator endpoints
- Rate limiting ready for API calls
- Data isolation between creators

## Next Steps

To complete the remaining Phase 4 features:

1. **Live Streaming**: 
   - Integrate WebRTC or streaming service
   - Build live video player component
   - Add real-time viewer count

2. **Duets/Collaborations**:
   - Create collaboration request UI
   - Implement split-screen video recording
   - Add notification system

3. **Extended Video Support**:
   - Add verification check in upload flow
   - Update video duration limits for verified users
   - Modify player for longer content

4. **Badge Display**:
   - Create badge component library
   - Add badge assignment workflows
   - Display on profiles and videos

## Usage

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts both Next.js frontend and Convex backend in parallel.

### Accessing Creator Features
Navigate to `/creator` when logged in as a creator account to access:
- Analytics Dashboard
- Audience Insights  
- Earnings & Tips
- Scheduled Posts
- Sponsorship Guidelines

### Testing
Creator features can be tested by:
1. Creating a test profile with `isCreator: true`
2. Generating mock analytics data
3. Scheduling test posts
4. Sending test tips
